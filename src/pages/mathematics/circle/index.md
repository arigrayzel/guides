## Circle

A circle is a 2D geometric shape. A circle is defined by the fact that every point on the circle is equal distance from one other point (the center).

The distance from any point on the circle to the center is called the "radius". The distance across the farthest part of the circle is known as the "diameter" and is twice as large as the radius. The total distance around the outside of the circle is known as the "circumference". Circumference is equal to the diameter times a value known as "pi" (π) which is approximately equal to 3.14. π is defined as the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle and is an irrational number.
